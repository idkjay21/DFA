1. You may build in prefab bases as long as they follow all the other rules of base rules

2. Prefab bases follow the same raid rules as regular bases but with the exception of 
   A. YOU MAY take over the base for your own group making the payout high!!!
   B. These bases are the only bases you can lower a flag on (Signals the take over)
   Must put in a Base verify Ticket to confirm take over

3. Dismantle the flag and put your own up to build. So Plan to bring correct items to dismantle

4. Raid the rest of the base if not already done.  Admins will NOT remove Locks, flags, doors or any items Period.

5. You must build the Entry point to close it in again as your Base.

7. IF you LOG IN from a long break and the base was taken over YOU must find a way out without dismantling or ADMINS HELP(even if it means F11)
